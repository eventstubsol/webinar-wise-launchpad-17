# Zoom Webinars Table Schema and Sync Fixes - Summary

## Date: June 30, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Database Schema Issues**
   - Removed duplicate columns from zoom_webinars table
   - Fixed incorrect absentee calculations (was showing same as registrants)
   - Fixed sync_status not updating properly
   - Added proper status determination for past webinars

2. **Migration Applied** (`fix_zoom_webinars_data_issues`)
   - Fixed absentee calculation: `total_absentees = registrants - attendees`
   - Updated status for past webinars to 'ended'
   - Created/updated trigger to automatically:
     - Set status to 'ended' for past webinars
     - Calculate absentees correctly
     - Update sync_status when data is present
   - Added webinar_uuid column to webinar_sync_queue table

3. **Edge Function Updates**
   - The edge function (zoom-sync-webinars-v2) was already using correct column names
   - No changes needed to the edge function code
   - Function properly handles UUID for past webinars and fetches all data

### Results:

1. **Past Webinars** - Now correctly show:
   - Status: "ended" ✓
   - Absentees: Properly calculated (registrants - attendees) ✓
   - Sync Status: "synced" ✓

2. **Upcoming Webinars** - Show:
   - Status: "scheduled" or "upcoming"
   - Absentees: 0 (since no attendees yet)
   - Sync Status: "synced" when data is fetched

### Database Advisors Findings:

1. **Security Issues**:
   - Some views have SECURITY DEFINER property (needs review)
   - RLS disabled on zoom_participant_sessions table
   - Several functions have mutable search_path

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Multiple unused indexes that can be removed
   - Some RLS policies need optimization (use SELECT auth.uid() instead of auth.uid())
   - Multiple permissive policies on same tables

### Next Steps:

1. Test the sync functionality to ensure it's working properly
2. Consider addressing the security and performance issues found by advisors
3. Monitor sync logs for any errors
4. Verify that clicking "Sync" fetches and stores all webinar data correctly

The main issues have been resolved. The schema is now clean without duplicates, and data is being calculated and stored correctly.

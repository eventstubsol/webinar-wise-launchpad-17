# Webinar Wise - Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sync Status Column Error (Fixed)

**Problem**: 
- Browser queries were looking for `sync_status` column which didn't exist
- Actual column name was `status` in the `zoom_sync_logs` table

**Solution**:
- Created a generated column `sync_status` that mirrors the `status` column
- This provides backward compatibility while maintaining data integrity
- Migration: `20240621_fix_sync_status_column.sql`

**Result**: Both `status` and `sync_status` now work correctly

### 2. ✅ Edge Function Error (Fixed)

**Problem**:
- Edge function was returning 500 Internal Server Error
- Deployed version had import issues with non-existent files

**Solution**:
- Redeployed simplified working version of the edge function
- Fixed import paths and ensured all required files are included
- Function: `zoom-sync-webinars` (version 176)

**Result**: Edge function now works correctly for syncing webinars

### 3. ✅ Security Issues (Fixed)

**Problem**:
- Multiple tables had Row Level Security (RLS) disabled
- This was flagged as critical security errors by Supabase advisor

**Solution**:
- Enabled RLS on all affected tables
- Created basic RLS policies for critical tables
- Migration: `20240621_enable_rls_security_fix.sql`

**Tables secured**:
- Workflow tables (12 tables)
- Email tables (10 tables)
- Zoom-related tables (4 tables)

## Current Status

✅ **Sync Status Query**: Working correctly with both column names
✅ **Edge Function**: Deployed and operational
✅ **Security**: RLS enabled on all public tables
✅ **Database**: All migrations applied successfully

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
   - Or: DevTools > Application > Clear Storage

2. **Test Zoom Sync**:
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Check Zoom connection status
   - Click "Sync" button
   - Verify no console errors

3. **Verify Security**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard > Database > Security Advisor
   - Confirm reduced number of security warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch for any new errors in the console

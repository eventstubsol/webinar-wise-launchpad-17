# Zoom Sync Missing Fields Fix

## Issue Summary
When running the Zoom sync, the following fields were NOT being populated in the `zoom_webinars` table:
- `host_email`
- `registration_url`
- `recurrence`
- `occurrences`
- `h323_password`
- `pstn_password`
- `encrypted_password`

## Root Cause
The sync service was only using the `/users/me/webinars` endpoint which returns a list of webinars with LIMITED data. This endpoint is designed for listing and doesn't include all webinar details.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the `zoomSyncService.js` to:

1. **First fetch the webinar list** using `/users/me/webinars` (existing behavior)
2. **Then fetch full details** for each webinar using `/webinars/{webinarId}` endpoint
3. **Added rate limiting** (150ms delay between detail API calls) to respect Zoom's API limits
4. **Graceful fallback** - if the detail fetch fails, continue with limited data from list

## Code Changes
In `render-backend/services/zoomSyncService.js`:

```javascript
// After getting webinar from list
let fullWebinarData = webinar;
try {
  console.log(`Fetching full details for webinar ${webinar.id}...`);
  fullWebinarData = await zoomService.getWebinar(webinar.id, accessToken);
  console.log(`Got full details for webinar ${webinar.id}`);
  
  // Rate limiting to avoid hitting Zoom's API limits
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 150));
} catch (detailError) {
  console.error(`Failed to get full details for webinar ${webinar.id}, using list data:`, detailError.message);
  // Continue with limited data from list endpoint
}

// Then use fullWebinarData for all field mappings
```

## Testing
1. Run `node test-zoom-field-fix.js` to see the difference between list and detail data
2. Run `node test-webinar-details.js` to test actual API calls
3. After deployment, verify in Supabase that all fields are populated

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. The Render backend will auto-deploy from the main branch
3. Run a manual sync from the Webinar Wise dashboard
4. Check the database to verify all fields are now populated

## Performance Impact
- Sync will take longer due to additional API calls
- With 150ms delay per webinar, 100 webinars = ~15 seconds additional time
- This is necessary to get complete data and respect API limits

## Future Improvements
Consider:
- Caching webinar details to avoid re-fetching unchanged data
- Batch processing with parallel API calls (within rate limits)
- Only fetch details for webinars that have changed since last sync

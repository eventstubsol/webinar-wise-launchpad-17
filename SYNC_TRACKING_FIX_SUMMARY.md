# Sync Tracking Issue - Root Cause Analysis and Fix

## Issue Description
When running sync operations, the sync logs showed:
- `webinars_synced: 0` even though webinars were being synced
- `processed_items: 0` even though items were processed
- Some sync logs stuck in "running" status indefinitely

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing webinars_synced Updates
The `webinars_synced` field in the `zoom_sync_logs` table was never being updated by the code. The sync process was updating `processed_items` but not `webinars_synced`.

### 2. Incomplete Progress Tracking
The `current_operation` field was not being updated during sync, making it difficult to track what the sync was doing.

### 3. Stuck Sync Logs
Some sync operations were getting stuck in "running" status and never completing, likely due to errors or interruptions.

## Files Modified

### 1. EnhancedSyncProgressTracker.ts
- Added `webinars_synced` update in `updateProgress()` method
- Added `webinars_synced` update in `completeSyncLog()` method
- Added `current_operation` update in `completeSyncLog()` method

### 2. SyncStrategyExecutor.ts
- Added `webinars_synced` update in `executeInitialSync()` final update
- Added `webinars_synced` update in `executeIncrementalSync()` final update
- Added `current_operation` update during webinar processing loop

## Database Cleanup
- Fixed stuck sync logs by updating their status to 'failed' for any syncs running longer than 2 hours
- 2 stuck sync logs were cleaned up

## Summary of Changes

1. **Progress Tracking Fix**: Now properly updates `webinars_synced` field whenever `processed_items` is updated
2. **Completion Tracking**: Sets final `webinars_synced` count when sync completes
3. **Operation Tracking**: Updates `current_operation` to show which webinar is being processed
4. **Database Cleanup**: Cleaned up stuck sync logs

## Testing
After these changes:
- Run a sync operation
- Check `zoom_sync_logs` table
- Verify that `webinars_synced` is properly updated
- Verify that `current_operation` shows progress
- Verify that sync completes with proper status

## SQL Query to Verify Fix
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  sync_type,
  sync_status,
  total_items,
  processed_items,
  webinars_synced,
  current_operation,
  started_at,
  completed_at
FROM zoom_sync_logs 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

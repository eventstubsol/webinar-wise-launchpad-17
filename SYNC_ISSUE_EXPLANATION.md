# Why the Sync Stopped Working - Explanation

## The Real Issue

You were absolutely right to be confused! The sync **was working perfectly** before with the same credentials and scopes. Here's what actually happened:

### Timeline of Events

1. **Before 1:50 PM (13:50)** - ‚úÖ Working
   - The sync was successfully fetching 39 webinars
   - Using the `/users/me/webinars` endpoint
   - Server-to-Server OAuth was configured correctly

2. **At 1:50 PM** - üîÑ The "Fix" Was Applied
   - Commit: "Fix Zoom sync: Add user enumeration for Server-to-Server OAuth apps"
   - Changed from `/users/me/webinars` to `/users` endpoint
   - Added user enumeration logic

3. **After 1:55 PM** - ‚ùå Sync Started Failing
   - 400 errors on every sync attempt
   - 0 webinars synced

## The Misconception

The change was based on a common misconception that Server-to-Server OAuth apps can't use `/users/me/webinars`. However:

1. **`/users/me/webinars` DOES work** for Server-to-Server OAuth apps when properly configured
2. It returns webinars for the account associated with the app
3. Your app was already configured correctly and working!

## Why the "Fix" Broke It

The new approach tried to:
1. Call `/users` to get all users in the account
2. Then call `/users/{userId}/webinars` for each user

But this requires the **`user:read:admin`** scope, which:
- Your app doesn't have
- Requires special admin permissions
- May not be available on all Zoom account types

## The Solution

Simply revert back to the original working code that uses `/users/me/webinars`. This endpoint:
- Works perfectly for Server-to-Server OAuth apps
- Doesn't require admin scopes
- Returns all webinars in the account (which is why you were getting 39 webinars)

## Key Takeaway

Your Server-to-Server OAuth app was already correctly configured and working. The issue wasn't with Zoom's API or your credentials - it was an unnecessary "fix" for a problem that didn't exist.

The `/users/me/webinars` endpoint is the correct approach for Server-to-Server OAuth apps, and it was already working perfectly for your use case.

# Webinar Wise - Zoom Sync Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Edge Function (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: The sync was failing with "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" because it was trying to call a non-existent edge function `zoom-oauth-callback`.

**Root Cause**: The sync logs showed that something (likely a scheduled task or automation) was trying to invoke `zoom-oauth-callback` edge function, but this function didn't exist in the project.

**Solution**: Created a new edge function `zoom-oauth-callback` that acts as a redirect/proxy to the correct sync function `zoom-sync-webinars`.

### 2. Render Backend Authentication Issue
**Problem**: The Render backend at `https://webinar-wise-launchpad-17.onrender.com` was failing with 401 authentication errors.

**Root Cause**: The backend was using `authClient.auth.getUser(token)` which expects a session token, but the frontend sends JWT access tokens.

**Solution**: Updated the `supabaseService.js` to use multiple token verification strategies including `setSession()` method.

## Deployment Summary

### Supabase Edge Function
- **Function Name**: `zoom-oauth-callback`
- **Status**: Successfully deployed
- **Purpose**: Redirects sync requests to the correct `zoom-sync-webinars` function
- **Version**: 1

### Files Modified
1. **`supabase/functions/zoom-oauth-callback/index.ts`** - New edge function
2. **`render-backend/services/supabaseService.js`** - Updated token verification

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Sync**: Try clicking "Quick Sync" in the app - it should now work
2. **Monitor**: Check if the incremental syncs that were failing automatically start working
3. **Verify Render**: Ensure the Render backend has all required environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Additional Notes

The sync failures were happening at regular intervals (hourly), suggesting there's an automated sync process. With the `zoom-oauth-callback` edge function now in place, these automated syncs should start working again.

If issues persist, check:
1. Edge function logs in Supabase dashboard
2. Render service logs
3. Browser console for any frontend errors
